    <h1>YUME NIKKI</h1>
    <h2>yume nikki itself</h2>
    <p>
      Yume nikki was a game developed by japanese developer Kikiyama. This is not
      their real name as opposed to a pseudonym. Though it was an independent game
      made in 2004 which was a year of trendsetters for independent games as cave story
      came out the same year. Indie games weren't as experimental or popular as they
      are now with games like minecraft and hotline miami which regularly become trends.
      Back then it was not as popular making yume nikki develop a smaller but more
      dedicated following.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now this game wouldn't spawn a whole sub genre if it wasn't unique, and if
      there is one word to describe yume nikki it is unique. It is a game about dreams.
      You play as a girl named Madotsuki who is completely disconnected from society
      to the point where she is unable to leave the house. Though the game shines when she sleeps
      you explore the dreams of this character on the journey for small effects to
      reach the ending. This makes for an interesting character study seeing how this
      character's mind is formed. The dreams are some of the most interesting landscapes
      one would find, neon worlds filled with strange monsters, a never ending forest
      a world that only has puddles, the dreams this character has are very unique.
      Truly making you feel like you are exploring someone else's dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      This game has developed a series of fan theories. Some have noticed the game
      has strong themes of isolation and social anxiety, with the main character either
      alone or being chased by human looking monsters. There is another strong example of
      this when you come across a picnic, though you can never get near as the world
      blocks your path. Though among the themes there is an interesting and rather
       dark theory, it is a possible theory the main character is an abuse survivor.
       There are images in the worlds that appear to connect to the mentality of a
       survivor haunted by memories. Though the creator has never weighted in on any of these
       which let the fandom grow as they constantly spread the theories.
    </p>
    <h3>The dawn of fan games</h3>
    <p>
      Yume nikki would obviously create many fan games inspired by this interesting
      form of character study. One of the most notable being .flow created by a
      programmer using the pseudonym lol in 2009. The gameplay closely resembles
      that of yume nikki exploring a dream world for effects. Though the main difference
      is that .flow definitely has a story that is conveyed by the main character's dream.
      Though before we get into the story it is interesting to note that the name
      comes from a psychological term which colloquially means being in the zone.
    </p>
    <p>
      .flow has much darker dreams having a more hospital like and disconnected setting
      the way the game acts it is like the character is trapped in their room,
      rather than not be willing to leave. One of these reasons is that in the dreams
      there is a disease called rust, and the character's name literally means
      covered in rust. As such the theories tend to go towards her being a young
      girl dying of a deadly disease which popular with the japanese fanbase.
      Though do to the fact that in this game you can kill the monsters chasing
      you, western fans believe that the main character is schizophrenic with a violent side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though in much lighter news the most popular fan game is the exact opposite.
      Called yume 2kki which in japanese sounds exactly like yume nikki as the
        japanese word for 2 is ni. This game was designed by a community of fans
        as the japanese forum 2chan got together to make a sequel. A lot of the
        people working on it made their own fan games and as such the experience
        of the developers shows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Due to the large community working on the game the theories has much less
      common its much harder to examine dreams as one thing when they came from
      many people after all. But at the same time there will definitely be dreams
      you have in this game. Maybe you have had a dream where you are trapped in
      a cocktail lounge filled with giant cocktails after having a few to many drinks
      or maybe a dream where you are exploring this non-euclidean space with fish
      flying in the air. Though this game also has nightmares as everyone has a few.
      Such as the dark museum a pitch black museum where only your lantern lights the room
      , while for the most part it would be empty you will hear something in one room.
      a quiet laugh is in the background, and as such you go to explore it.
      When you get close it gets slightly louder and as you get closer eventually
      you see a distorted, bloody face stuck into the wall. While this might not seem
      that horrifying what affects someone in their nightmares may be oddly tame.
    </p>
    <p>
      These kinds of games show why video games can be a strong narrative medium.
      While a live action movie could look technically better could not recreate the
      imagery of the world. Though at the same time while an animated production
      or a book could describe the world perfectly those suffer from the issue that
      you are not the one exploring. Games have the natural sense of freedom of the
      user being in control, which best shows the freedom and chaos of ones dreams.
      There are many reasons why this medium shows that games can do what do other
      media can but if I continued it could overshadow the main topic.

    <h1>META NARRATIVE GAMES</h1>
    <h2>OFF</h2>
    <p>
      OFF is a game created by martin Georis or Mortis Ghost as that is the pseudonym
      he used for the game. Released by the belgium studio Unproductive Fun Time
      in 2008. While the game was fairly small at first it garnered a strong following
      after a fan translation was released. This was due to the bizarre world,
      and intersting puzzles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gameplay is OFF is a standard jrpg using the time system popularized
      by the legendary series final fantasy. With the standard elements one would
      expect the fights do not stand out but the game also includes puzzles which
      were suprisingly good being actual puzzles instead of take x to y which most
      games include. Though the gameplay isn't where the game got it's following its
      the bizarre world. It is broken not in pieces but the design is almost straight
      out of a corrupted wonderland, with people mining for air, butchers killing cows
      not for meat but for rare metals where the very ground itself is made of the leftovers.
      This game is bizarre with the characters beaten down by living in this world
      being obsessed with the few pleasantries they have.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meta element came from the name OFF. For one the game isn't downloaded
      as the game itself, you open a file creating the game. This plays to the theme
      of you being the one who caused the world to be created the way it is. As
      such it is your responsibility to fix it. By turning the world OFF
    </p>
    <h3>The expansion on meta games</h3>
    <h4>one shot</h4>
    <p>
      One shot was another interesting game but much more story focused and recent
      than any other games that will be on this list so I will avoid anything other
      than the bare basics of the story. The plot involes a character waaking up
      in a new world. The world is dying and the character has the lightbulb that
      acts as the world's sun. Putting him on the quest to save the world.
      There are of course a variety of twists as turns including you being
      the world's god but it is only right to leave finding those twists, to
      the reader.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the real meat of the game and where it stands out is the gameplay.
      As the name suggests you only get one shot, if you close the game, or exit
      out of it that is it the game ends there. But not only that when you beat
      the game you can not get the other ending it is locked from you. Which
      really makes you feel like your choices matter, adding a sense of finality.
      Not only that but the gameplay itself also used the fact that the game took
      place in the computer quite masterfully. With certain puzzles creating files
      on your computer that you need to find in order to progress causing the game
      to have a tangible effect on the world, even if it is just some files
      it symbolically helps the player see the game world as more alive.
    </p>
    <h4>Space funeral</h4>
    <p>
      This game will only get a brief overview due to its strange nature being
      very apparent by looking at just screenshots of the game. The plot of the
      game follows the character phillip a despressed boy in pajamas always crying.
      His family kicks him out and he makes his way to a wizard the only one that
      can help him. On his way he encounters a creature called leg horse, a horse
      made out of disembodied legs, who at first is rude to him but when finding
      out they have the same goal joins along. On their way they find glitches
      in the world, which is what caused it to be so terrible and disgusting.
      As the cast makes their way through the world it just becomes more glitched
      and glitched. When the finally arrive to the wizard's home, the perfect city,
      it is glitched like the rest of the world. The next chapter will be about spoilers
      and meta commentary so if you are interested you might want to skip it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main antagonist is an artist called moon. The originally went to the city
      due to hearing of its perfection and hoping to be inspired. When they arrived
      they found themselves more bored of the world then anything else deciding
      the world needed to be changed. They brought about the glitches and made the
      world the way it is. The world is fixed after they are defeated. But the
      theme is against how many games and media in general view the past with rose
      tinted glasses. Seeing that as a terrible ideology that serves only to make
      the world more boring, that even the strange and insane is better. The main
      characters reject the innovation going back to the world they knew. Now
      this can easily be interpreted in a variety of ways, having the villain be
      the artist makes it so the message could be either side. Or it could be viewed
      similar to OFF examining the idea of an inexperienced creator making a world,
      and how maybe it would be better if it was destroyed.

    <h1>RPG MAKER HORROR GAMES</h1>
    <h2>brief disclaimer</h2>
    <p>
      brief summary before talking about this genre. While it is one of the most
      popular games on rpg maker I will also say it is more likely to be miss than
      other genres. For a few reasons one of which being it is much easier to make.
      Yume nikki games require a lot of strange worlds built on imagination, meta
      games require actual programming in order to make the strange narrative work.
      A second notable one being most horror writing is not good. What is scary
      for one might not be for another on top as someone else seeing it as edgy.
      Though the game mentioned will be one of actual quality.
    </p>
    <h2>Yume nikki inspiration</h2>
    <p>
      Yume nikki was quite the notable game as you already know if you read that
      section already. Funnily enough it also inspired rpg maker horror games.
      Maybe due to the gameplay being simple enough it inspired others to use the
      style.Though another possibility is the nightmare segments in the game showed
      how even with minimal graphics one could bring about a sense of unease.
      Either way it puts quite this site in quite the pickle, yume nikki is big
      enough to be it's own genre, but at the same time brought about a rise in
      the genre of horror games made in rpg maker. Making the argument IB should
      be in yume nikki fan games or yume nikki should be in horror are both valid.
    </p>
    <h2>IB</h2>
    <p>
      IB is probably the most famous and popular rpg maker horror game if one doesn't
      count yume nikki. It starts in an art gallery where the main character named
      IB eventually finds herself inside a hellworld she entered through a painting.
      An interesting detail you will find in the art gallery is that since the main
      character is still a child she doesn't know certain words. As such those words
      will appear as question marks putting you in the shoes of the main character.
      Showly the world slowly becomes more and more distorted with the art coming
      alive and becoming very hostile. Throughout the games there will be a lot of
      puzzles in order to progress which is most of the gameplay in the game itself.
      The atmosphere of the game is really well done. The music is perfectly executed
      in order to make scenes creepier or a calming atmosphere when need be.
    </p>
    <p>
      The story of IB is about maturity, and how people see the world differently.
      This is first notable when playing as the second main character gary. Gary
      sees the art very differently than IB something that will be cute for her,
      would be horrifying and generally distorted. Which can be seen in real life
      how some adults see some children toys as disturbing like certain dolls.
      Though this is also seen with the main character experiencing hell slowly
      growing up over the course of the game. This is shown very well in the ending
      when the main character returns to the real world, she will understand words
      she didn't before.
